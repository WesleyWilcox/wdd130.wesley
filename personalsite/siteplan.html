      <h3>3D Lego and Blender Art</h3>
      <p>
        This Page is for displaying my 3D Lego and Blender art.

        This Lego artwork was made using LeoCad. It was then uploaded to an old viewer software called “LDView” to make it appear more “retro.” It is based off of a blue, lego fish that a friend created. 
        
        This lego artwork was made in the same process. It is an original design of a duck with a crown. I use this design on my personal instagram page.

        This creation was made in the same process of building in the LeoCAD program and uploading it to an old viewer. It is a character that one of my friends designed. It features a purple cube with an eye and a musical note for an eyebrow. 

        This artwork was also made in the same process. It is an original character of one of my friends. It features a kirby-esque character with a long nose and no arms.

        This is one of my simpler LeoCAD designs. It features what is supposed to resemble a leek with a smiling face. It was made in LeoCAD and rendered with LDView.

        As I continue to make artworks, my portfolio on this page will expand.

      <h3>2D Vector Art</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for displaying my 2D vector Art.

        This is a vector artwork of Hop Pop Planter from the Amphibia series. He was based off of someone's design for a bullfrog.
        
        This is a vector artwork for an asian small claw otter. They are a freshwater species of otter in Japan.

        This is a vector artwork for a Black Rat Snake. I took many liberties while making this artwork to make it appear visually appealing. 

        This vector artwork is of a fictional species of coconut crab. For its gray tone, I appropriately call it “Iron Coconut Crab.”

        This is a vector artwork I made for one of my friends. It is a man with a taco for his head.
