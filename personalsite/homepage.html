    <h2>Greetings! This is a portfolio website which I made for fun.</h2>

    <h4>This portfolio's function is to display artworks that I made in a neat and organized manner.</h4>
    
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <h4>Displaying my artworks will in practice give users inspiration in their own works. This website will also benefit me as I go back and reflect on the artworks I made, motivating me to continue pursuing my interests.</h4>

    <h5>I take a lot of inspiration from early 3D game renders like Super Mario 64.</h5>

    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>

    <h4>This site is for anyone that is interested in my work, whether it be potential investors or individuals requesting assistance or inspiration for their own works, as well as myself. I hope that what you find here will help you.</h4>

    <h4>Uploading my art in a neat, ordered list will be helpful in letting anyone access my art history. This also lets me practice in creating a website.</h4>
